# Using yarn or pnpm
> yarn/pnpm add https://github.com/express-rate-limit/rate-limit-memcached/releases/download/v{version}/rate-limit-memcached.tgz
```

Replace `{version}` with the version of the package that you want to your, e.g.:
`1.0.0`.

## Usage

**This package requires you to use Node 16 or above.**

An example of its usage is as follows:

```ts
import { rateLimit } from 'express-rate-limit'
import { MemcachedStore } from 'rate-limit-memcached'

const limiter = rateLimit({
	windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes.
	max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per `window` (here, per 15 minutes).
	standardHeaders: 'draft-7', // Return rate limit info in the `RateLimit` header.
	legacyHeaders: false, // Disable the `X-RateLimit-*` headers.
	store: new MemcachedStore({
		// prefix: 'rl:', // The prefix attached to all keys stored in the cache.
		locations: ['localhost:11211'], // The server location(s), passed directly to Memcached.
	}),
})

// Apply the rate limiting middleware to all requests
app.use(limiter)
```

## Configuration

### `prefix`

> `string`

The text to prepend to all keys stored by this package in Memcached.

Defaults to `rl:`.

### `client`

> `MemcachedClient`

The client used to make requests to the Memcached server. Must have the
following methods:

- `get: (key, callback)`
- `del: (key, callback)`
- `set: (key, value, lifetime, callback)`
- `add: (key, value, lifetime, callback)`
- `incr: (key, delta, callback)`
- `decr: (key, delta, callback)`

> Here, `key` is a string, `value` and `delta` are numbers, and `lifetime` is
> the time in seconds until it expires.

Defaults to an instance of [`memcached`](https://github.com/3rd-Eden/memcached),
created with the `locations` and `config` options (see below for details) passed
to it.

### `locations`

A list of memcached servers to store the keys in, passed to the default
Memcached client.

Note that the default client is only used if an alternative `client` is not
passed to the store.

Defaults to `['localhost:11211']`.

### `config`

> `object`

The configuration passed to the default Memcached client.

Defaults to `{}`.
